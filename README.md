# Mathbrode

This repo is a part of the final project I presented at my training at La Capsule. The presentation was on the 29th of Decembre. Since then, I've worked on it to make it viable. 
This repo is "faulty" because the deploy on NEtlify didn't work as expected; only the index.html page was read by the browser. 
I've started a new React app from scratch with only the needed code to be able the deploy it correctly; [Mathbrode](https://github.com/CamilleRungette/Mathbrode), it contains all of the evolution since I stopped working on this app

I intend to look deeper into it to fix this problem in the future.
